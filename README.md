Universal Logic Units, a digital lego

Universal Logic Units are modular digital building blocks. See it as digital Lego. I have created ULUs because I wanted to play with digital logic, like playing with Lego. When you have an idea, you just grab your ULUs, connect them to each other and build something. It is that easy. Show your children or family how digital technology works. Sensor based systems, logic experiments, a 4-bit computer or a Turing machine can be built with ULUs.
